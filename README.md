# crypto_O

Replacing imperative, mutating C code with barely functional, mutating Clojure code
to implement cryptographic logic.

Don't use this for anything serious! This is just for playing around with crypto.

Huge kudos to http://www.samiam.org for all the amazing work! Much was adapted
or taken outright, but I claim all errors.

## Usage

* Production is RIGHT OUT.
* This is likely wrong AND insecure.
* Also, the code is crude and rough Clojure. Look elsewhere for good examples!
